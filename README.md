# Dependencies_To_run_Tmux_in_Windows

Tmux is a terminal multiplexer – a popular (even essential) command-line tool that allows one to divide a console/terminal window 
into multiple “panes” and render the output of a shell and/or tool in each “pane”, and to switch input between each pane.

After some browsing and researching I finally got a way to run tmux in windows.
Download or install  git of version 2.27
http://www.npackd.org/p/git64/2.27
and copy the files tmux.exe,msys-event-2-1-7.dll and msys-event_core-2-1-7.dll into
<b>C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin</b> this path.Then simply rerun the git bash.

Done 💯
